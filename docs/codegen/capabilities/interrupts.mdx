## Overview

Codegen supports **real-time interrupts** that allow users to send additional messages or clarifications while the agent is actively working on a task. This feature enables dynamic, conversational interactions where users can provide feedback, corrections, or additional context without waiting for the agent to complete its current work.

## How Interrupts Work

When Codegen is actively processing a request, users can send follow-up messages through supported channels (Slack, Linear) that will be immediately delivered to the running agent as "interrupt messages."

### Key Features

- **Real-time delivery**: Messages are delivered immediately to the active agent
- **Context preservation**: The agent maintains full context of the original task
- **Immediate acknowledgment**: Codegen typically responds quickly to acknowledge the interrupt
- **Seamless integration**: The agent incorporates new information into its current workflow

## Supported Channels

### Slack Interrupts

In Slack, you can send interrupt messages by:

1. **Replying in the thread** where Codegen is working
2. **Mentioning @codegen** with additional context
3. **Sending follow-up messages** in the same channel

<Warning>
  **Important**: You **must** mention `@codegen` in your interrupt messages for
  Codegen to respond in Slack channels, unless you're in a direct message (DM)
  with Codegen where it will respond automatically.
</Warning>

**Example:**

```
User: @codegen can you fix the login bug?
Codegen: I'll fix the login bug! 🔧 [starts working]
User: Actually, make sure to also handle the password reset flow
Codegen: Got it! I'll include the password reset flow in my fix 👍
```

### Linear Interrupts

In Linear, interrupts work through:

1. **Adding comments** to the issue Codegen is working on
2. **Updating the issue description** with additional requirements
3. **Changing issue priority or labels** (triggers re-evaluation)

<Info>
  **Note**: Codegen will respond automatically to your comments in Linear unless
  another user is tagged in the same comment.
</Info>

**Example:**

```
Issue: Fix authentication system
Codegen: Working on the authentication fix...
[User adds comment]: "Please also add 2FA support"
Codegen: I see you've added 2FA requirements - incorporating that now!
```

## Best Practices

### For Users

<Tip>
  **Send interrupts early**: If you realize you need to add context or change
  requirements, send the message immediately rather than waiting for completion.
</Tip>

- **Be specific**: Clearly state what you want to add or change
- **Provide context**: Explain how the new information relates to the original request
- **Use @mentions in Slack**: Always mention @codegen in Slack channels (not needed in DMs)
- **No mentions needed in Linear**: Codegen responds automatically unless other users are tagged

### Common Use Cases

1. **Adding requirements**: "Also make sure to add error handling"
2. **Providing clarification**: "By 'users' I meant admin users specifically"
3. **Changing scope**: "Actually, let's focus on the mobile version first"
4. **Sharing additional context**: "Here's the error log I forgot to include"
5. **Course correction**: "That approach won't work, try using the new API instead"

## Limitations

- **Processing order**: Interrupts are processed in the order they're received
- **Context switching**: Very frequent interrupts may slow down overall progress
- **Channel-specific**: Interrupts only work within the same channel/issue where work started

## Troubleshooting

### Interrupt Not Acknowledged

If your interrupt isn't acknowledged:

1. **Check the channel**: Ensure you're messaging in the same thread/issue
2. **Wait briefly**: The agent may be in the middle of a long operation
3. **Use @mentions in Slack**: Make sure you mentioned @codegen (required in channels, not DMs)
4. **Check for other tags in Linear**: If you tagged other users, Codegen won't respond automatically
5. **Check agent status**: The agent may have completed or encountered an error

### Message Not Incorporated

If your interrupt seems ignored:

1. **Be more explicit**: Clearly state what you want changed
2. **Reference the original task**: Connect your interrupt to the current work
3. **Follow up**: Send a clarifying message if needed

## Examples

### Slack Thread Example

```
User: @codegen create a user registration form
Codegen: I'll create a user registration form! 📝 [working...]

User: Make sure it includes email verification
Codegen: Got it! Adding email verification to the registration form 📧

User: And add password strength requirements
Codegen: Perfect! I'll include password strength validation as well 🔒
```

### Linear Issue Example

```
Linear Issue: "Implement search functionality"
Codegen: Working on search functionality...

[User adds comment]: "Please include filters for date and category"
Codegen: I see you've added filter requirements - implementing date and category filters now!

[User adds comment]: "Also add sorting options"
Codegen: Adding sorting options to the search as well! 📊
```
